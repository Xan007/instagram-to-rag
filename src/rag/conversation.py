"""Multi-turn conversation support for the RAG engine.

Design: the CLIENT owns the conversation history and sends it on every
request; this service stays stateless (survives restarts and scale-to-zero,
nothing personal is ever persisted server-side). The engine consumes that
history in two places:

1. Question condensation: follow-up questions like "y para principiantes?"
   are meaningless on their own; they are rewritten into a self-contained
   search query BEFORE embedding/retrieval.
2. Answer generation: a trimmed transcript keeps the answer coherent with
   what was already said.

All helpers are pure or fall back gracefully; a condensation failure must
never break the query itself.
